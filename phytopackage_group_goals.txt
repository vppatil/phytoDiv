R package group objectives statement.

vision of complete success- 
	1) clear criteria for evaluating phytoplankton data quality
	2) automated/reproducible tools for
		a. cleaning taxonomy names
			-spelling errors
			-taxonomic standards
			-higher taxonomy
			-parsing var./ssp.
			
		b. mapping species on to functional classifications
		-Nico MFG
		-CSR
		-Clark/kruk trait matrices
		
	3) helper functions to
		- update libraries
		- apply functions across whole data frames
		- gap fill functional classifications based on taxonomic relatedness
		
	4) published R package on CRAN and draft companion paper (by next workshop).
	5) programmatic interface with algaebase and/or wrappers for taxize functions

objectives (for workshop)
	- create github account for r package code (vijay)
	- instructions for r package creation and function checking (marc)
	- finalize/document functional group mapping functions (clark/vijay)
	- contact algaebase admin - cosigned by GEISHA PI's (vijay)
	- revise algaebase R scraping function (vijay/marc)
	- decision rules for evaluating taxize name resolution function (vijay/marc/clark)
	- benchmark taxize and algaebase against list of trouble species (all, with help from nico)
	- benchmark/summarize performance of functions on available lakes
		% matches by lakes and over time, by taxonomic groups (all)
	- create CSR classification function(all)
	- apply functions to all available datasets

	for after workshop
	- look for resources for trait table filling (clark)
	- incorporate needs from phyto group in terms of their workflow/hypotheses (all)
	- list hypotheses for functional trait ecosystem function analyses (clark)
	- brainstorm ideas for package paper (all)

Barriers to success
	- algaebase permission (algaebase PI's)
	- criteria for evaluating data quality (phyto group-Nico/Rita/Orlane)
	- logic/library for creating CSR classifications (Nico/Rita/Orlane)
	- gaps in species - functional group libraries (clark/Vijay)
	- list of test species- things to use for evaluating (Nico)
